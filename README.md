## 📄 What is x402?

x402 is an open payment protocol built on top of HTTP using the long-reserved `402 Payment Required` status code. It enables AI agents, clients, and web services to conduct **autonomous pay-per-use payments** using stablecoins such as USDC on EVM-compatible blockchains.

It allows seamless machine-native transactions:

* No API keys
* No subscriptions
* No accounts
* No chargebacks
* Instant payments
